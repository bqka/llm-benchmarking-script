My aunt and brother, in the past, instead of going after my dad for his shit, they instead put all the blame on my mother. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIT PEOPLE?! My mother has been through 2 cancers and survived, had just retired form her stressful office space and now she's being treated like this by some shithead of a father?!
