Hello!: )

I'm a new user so if this post ends up in a weird place/thread, pls bear w me.

Has anyone used Ancestry.com lately? They offer a two week trial but still require your credit card information. Is this suspicious? It doesn't cost anything for the first two weeks, and then you can end the trial so you don't have to pay anything even then, but I just feel a little uncomfortable dialing my credit card information on there online.... Am I being too doubtfull? Share your experiences?

Thank you!

my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon
shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave

she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me""

half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his.""

and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row.

not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me.

I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least). 
Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship. 
Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her.
I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way.
